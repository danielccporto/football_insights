# Football Insights

## **Project Description**
**Football Insights** is an interactive football match analysis application that combines data retrieval, AI-driven insights, and an engaging user interface. It uses **Streamlit** for the frontend, **LangChain** for agent-based reasoning with Google Gemini Pro, and **StatsBombPy** for accessing comprehensive football data, including matches, events, and player statistics.

The primary goal of the project is to allow users to:
- Select competitions, seasons, and matches.
- Retrieve match details, starting XI, and player statistics.
- Receive AI-generated insights and commentary on matches.
